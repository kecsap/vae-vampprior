# vae-vampprior
Tensorflow implementation of the VAE with VampPrior paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07120) for the Machine Learning, Advanced Course at KTH


Implemented by 

- Francesco Zappia (Standard VAE)
- Vittorio Zampinetti (VampPrior)
- Marco Schouten (HVAE)

More generally each of the authors influenced and contributed on each other's work.

Part of the implementation is inspired by 

- the authors' implementation of the paper [on GitHub](https://github.com/jmtomczak/vae_vampprior)
- Tensorflow [tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_layers_and_models)
